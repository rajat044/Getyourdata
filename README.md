Get_Your_Result.ipynb

  I created this program when I was in 5th semester of Polytechinc(Electronics Engineering). I created to extract the result data of every student in my class(1st shift, 2nd shift, and K group students). 
  
  Most_Inovative.ipynb
    
    This program extracts data about 60 countries and their indexs of inovation, startup friendlyness, and investment from a website and stores this all data into CSV file. So we can do data manipulation.
